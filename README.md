## What Chapar means?
Chapar was the institution of the royal mounted couriers in ancient Persia.
The messengers, called Chapar, alternated in stations a day's ride apart along the Royal Road.
The riders were exclusively in the service of the Great King and the network allowed for messages to be transported from Susa to Sardis (2699 km) in nine days; the journey took ninety days on foot.

Herodus described the Chapar as follows:

> There is nothing in the world that travels faster than these Persian couriers. Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor darkness of night prevents these couriers from completing their designated stages with utmost speed.
>
> Herodotus, about 440 BC
